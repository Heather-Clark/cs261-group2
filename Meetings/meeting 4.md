- Questions

Q: How powerful should the AI be? Should the chatbot be doing lots of analysis or more calculation based/ return simple information?

Q: How do DB track/ store portfolios? (Could look to support csv file upload or similar)

Q: While security isn't a prototype concern, should it be discussed in the reports?

Q: Is there an exhaustive list of calculation based (or those that require lots of processing) queries our chatbot should be able to deal with?

Q: UI size and style, are there any specific criteria? How much screen space should be aim to use?
