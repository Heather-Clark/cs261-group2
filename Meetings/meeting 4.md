### Agenda
- Plan feedback
- Questions

Q: How powerful should the AI be? Should the chatbot be doing lots of analysis or more calculation based/ return simple information?

Should be able to handle things that are outlined in the slides. For complex analysis like graphs, more relevant information is better. There is obviously a limit, however it's a safe assumption to make for them to want diferences between the beginning of the day and now. This is more of an implementation question. In theory, the specification is "I want to ask question and want answer back". Requirements and analysis report should have fair amount of detail. Good undertsand of requirements, risks, how long it will take to implement. Not looking for anything implementation specific. Specifying mutliple levels of detail, with prioritise laid out. Can split up the task into different sections, such as interface, socket, API etc. 

Either format for tlaking about group roles is fine. Life will be easier if different people do different things, and everybody knows each other's tasks. Not everyone on front end, some people on back end. That's management, how that is presented in the report is up to you. Could have the person responsible for a section introduced while discussing the section. 


Q: How do DB track/ store portfolios? (Could look to support csv file upload or similar)

Q: While security isn't a prototype concern, should it be discussed in the reports?

Q: Is there an exhaustive list of calculation based (or those that require lots of processing) queries our chatbot should be able to deal with?

Q: UI size and style, are there any specific criteria? How much screen space should be aim to use?
